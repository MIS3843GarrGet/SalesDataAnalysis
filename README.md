This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing sales data. It provides a set of data cleaning and analysis tools to help you gain insights from your sales data.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system and the required libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Data Cleaning
The data-cleaning script in this repository performs the following tasks:

Renaming columns for consistency.
Mapping products to correct categories.
Converting data types.
Handling missing values.
Splitting addresses into separate columns {city, road, state, Zip_code}.
Detecting and removing duplicate rows.
